        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic family burger so good that it will have heads rolling! Think you won't be able to make the burger blessed by Fujimoto?
            Well think again, as the Kobeni Burger exceeds in its simplicity, allowing any family to enjoy it. Best enjoyed with a clumsy cute japanese waitress
            who used to be a public devil hunter.
